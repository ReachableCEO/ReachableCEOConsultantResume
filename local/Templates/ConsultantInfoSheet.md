# {{ConsultantName}} Candidate Information Sheet

## Introduction

Hello,

I apologize for the form letter response.

I receive a high volume of recruiter emails every day and I've found this letter to be the most efficient way to
handle the high volume of emails and reduce back and forth emails/texts/calls.

If you have any questions/comments/concerns not covered by this document, please let me know via e-mail and I'm happy to address them!

If you ask me something answered in this document, I will not respond and will not move forward with the opportunity, so please read it in detail!

## Re: share my ID over email

I WILL NOT share my (full or redacted) photo ID over email or any other electronic written  
communication. If that is "required" then I have no interest in moving forward with this opportunity.

I am happy to get on a teams/zoom/google meet etc call and show my ID.

## Re: professional references

I am happy to provide professional references once an interview with the end client/customer/hiring manager/team has been scheduled. I will NOT provide references up front. If that is "required" then I have no interest in moving forward with this opportunity.

## Re: relocation

if the role is not based in **{{ConsultantLocation}}** or **Other Location** I will need to re-locate

| Question                                  | Answer |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|
| Am I open to relocation?                  | Yes    |
| Am I willing to re-locate at own expense? | No     |

- The net amount of the re-location benefit **MUST be at least {{ConsultantRelocationNetMinimumAmount}}** to fully compensate me for the time/effort to re-locate.
- The full re-location benefit **must be provided prior to the confirmed start date**.
